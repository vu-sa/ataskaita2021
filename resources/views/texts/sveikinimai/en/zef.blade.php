    <p>Dear VU SR, </p>
    <p>There are two points of view in many situations – either seeing everything that is going on around us as a problem (threat) that needs to be defended against, or as an opportunity that needs to be seized. Perhaps we could agree that the second approach is better? </p>
    <p>In order for an organization (whether an individual or people of an organization) to see more opportunities than threats, it takes just two things. First of all, do not be afraid of uncertainty. It is more correct not to panic because the brain cannot put everything in a drawer, because then the defense functions focused on survival are activated and the status quo becomes, at that time, the only acceptable alternative. </p>
    <p>You may think “what kind of nonsense does he write here?” Better to think of the last situation when someone suggested some big change, something not taken for granted or everyday. Your first reaction: a) here you can do that and that; b) what about that and how about that? Here it will be one way or another!!! Much of human history is an attempt to put the world in drawers. We cannot eliminate this, but when we understand this aspect, we may not give in to it: reject the initial protective reactions and openly discuss and look for opportunities. </p>
    <p>However, uncertainty does not lead to unplanned ad hoc action (which is always to some extent unavoidable). On the contrary, having the direction (vision, strategy) can significantly reduce the horrors of uncertainty. Here it is as with a Cheshire cat. Imagine you are lost, you don’t know where you are (uncertainty). You reach a crossroad, but don’t even know where you want to go (strategy). Then the cat says that both, the right and the left, are equally good, because you still don’t know where you want to go. The situation is not clear – the stress is increasing. And if you’re just as lost (uncertainty) but when you come to a crossroad you know you want to get to the nearest place X, then you know which way to turn. Has the uncertainty disappeared in this scenario? No. you’re still lost, but at least you know which way to go, one step at a time. </p>
    <p>So, when you know clearly what you want to achieve, even when something like a pandemic happens, it doesn’t stop working. Even when there is such a huge amount of uncertainty around you, you can understand which decisions lead to your (organization's) vision. You have succeeded in proving that you are able to act and represent students properly – you have fought to record lectures or give their content to students, and to reduce the social challenges for students in the face of a pandemic. Finally, a national plan for the social dimension, which seems to finally become a reality! VU SR was the first organization to start talking about the social dimension in Lithuania in 2013 and it is only through the long-term efforts of VU SR that this area can finally move forward significantly. </p>
    <p>Was it hard this year? No one said it would be easy. Will it be difficult next year? (See previous answer). </p>
    <p>It would be a mistake not to seize the opportunities created by the pandemic. There are many of them both in representation and within the organization. I wish you to seize them! One step at a time. </p>
