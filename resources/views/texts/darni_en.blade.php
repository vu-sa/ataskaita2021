COMMUNITY BUILDING EVENTS </b></p>
<p>Fostering community spirit and student integration remains an important priority of Vilnius University Students’ Representation. For several years in a row, VU SR has been actively taking care of the offer of social-academic and community events, strengthening and expanding projects, clubs and programs that are open to all members of the VU community. In this way, VU SR promotes a cohesive, open community that fosters university traditions. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>VU SA 31</STRONG></h3>
<p>Somewhat differently than every year, on November 20-21, International Student Day and the 31st birthday of Vilnius University Students’ Representation (hereinafter VU SR 31) were celebrated. Three discussions took place on the occasion of these two holidays. International Student Day and VU SR 31 on November 20th opened a discussion on <a class="fs-6" href="https://youtu.be/rNX9kw_2rR0"> "How will we strengthen higher education in the next four years?"</a>, during which higher education was discussed. The commemoration continued on November 21st the other two discussions, which took place in English. <a class="fs-6" href="https://youtu.be/TvuDCZccCzw">“The COVID-19: students' movement without crossing borders”</a> discussed the difficulties, challenges and problems that students encounter in the face of a pandemic in order to try their studies abroad. The commemoration of International Student Day was closed with a discussion on <a class="fs-6" href="https://youtu.be/XblJYYnpc5Q">“What kind of student movement do students need today?”</a>, in which they discussed what kind of student movement is needed for today’s students. Although we could not be together, we had the opportunity to hear the thoughts of different people, speeches to students on issues of concern. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>VU Study Fair 2021 </STRONG></h3>
<p>Like most events, the annual Study Fair was moved to online space this year. Vilnius University independently took the initiative and provided the graduates with an experience as similar as possible to the live Study Fair. During the Study Fair, VU SR was not only responsible for organizing discussions with students about studies, but also contributed to the implementation of the technical event: students administered remote consultation rooms and even for 2 weeks, from March 24th to April 2nd everyone was working to make the Study Fair run smoothly. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Unit days </STRONG></h3>
<p>In 2021, as never before, there were many days of well-organized unit days events that attracted many participants. Organizing unit days remotely was not a problem for any unit, and all events lacked original and engaging activities. This year VU SR TF delighted us with the Constitution and Lawyers' Days, VU SR FF already celebrated the 53rd Physicists' Day, the 42nd Historians' Day was a great start to the VU SR IF events marathon, this year's VU SR MF gave us the opportunity to hear real professional lectures and discussions, VU SR KF prepared a lot of information that we could hear during the Information Days, VU SR FilF inspired creativity organized Philologists’ Night, Business Days after a year break returned and visited VU SR VM, VU SR EVAF surprised by organizing great Mercury days, VU SR MIF Days of Mathematicians and Informatics, and VU SR TSPMI Politicians' Day really included not only those interested in politics.

<p>On September 8th-14th, 2020, before the start of the new academic year, 16 freshman camps organized by VU SR and traditionally took place at Vilnius University. Due to the epidemiological situation in Lithuania, traditional, multi-day outreach camps were abandoned this year - the camps were shortened to one day and took place in the yards near the units. This year, more than 1,200 future VU students took part in them. During the camps, the University culture, lecturers, alumni and departmental administrations were introduced, Vilnius University was presented, basic information about the study process and study environment was provided, VU SR activities, programs, clubs and projects and student opportunities at VU were presented. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Integration Fair  </STRONG></h3>
<p> Although the September 1st march, which has become traditional this year, did not take place, on September 12th, on the occasion of the beginning of the school year, VU SR organized a festival of twelve discussions with the academic community “Ad astra”. Throughout the day, the courtyards of the Central Palace of Vilnius University rang from discussions between representatives of different disciplines, administrative staff, students and guests. Not only about studies, science and opportunities at the University were discussed, but also about the information world, propaganda, equality and the leadership of the University in the country. </p>
<p> After the discussions, the participants were greeted by a fair of organizations, programs, clubs and projects operating at the University, where students could get acquainted with various student organizations and opportunities for self-expression at VU. The evening was crowned by the greetings of Rector Rimvydas Petrauskas and the President of VU SR Justas Kvedaravičius and a community concert in the Great Yard. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>VU 442th birthday </STRONG></h3>
<p>This year we had to celebrate Vilnius University's birthday remotely. As the entire VU community has been going through quarantine for a long time, it was decided to organize a celebration and bring together the entire Vilnius University community. More than 40 teams tested themselves in the VU 442 birthday mind battle "Traps of Social Networks" organized by VU SR. We are very glad that during such a difficult period, we were able to provide the community of Vilnius University with another beautiful, fun and community-gathering event. </p>
