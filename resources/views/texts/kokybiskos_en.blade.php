    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> <b>Official Writings</b> </h1>


    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>On the coordination of the draft order of the Minister of Education, Science and Sports (27 August 2020) </i></h3>
    <p>VU SR responded to the Minister of Education, Science and Sports of the Republic of Lithuania in 2020. the order of 10 July, which distributed the number of students with minor pedagogy studies receiving financial support in 2020. Under the initial procedure, only 15 out of 70 students who had chosen to study pedagogy at the time would have been eligible for scholarships, a disproportionately small and discriminatory funding model which discourages further study and at the same time reduces the diversity of teacher training methods. VU SR also singled out a specific proposal to provide support to the remaining 55 VU students who chose to acquire the qualification of a teacher while studying in minor pedagogy studies. </p>


    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Regarding the distribution of the number of pedagogical part-time students supported in 2020 by higher education institutions and groups of study fields (14 September 2020) </i></h3>
    <p>In response to the reply of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sports of the Republic of Lithuania to the previous letter (On the coordination of the draft order of the Minister of Education, Science and Sports), VU SR continued to take the position to allocate support to the remaining 55 students. VU SR pointed out that the state funds allocated for the financing of studies, but not used, could be redistributed and focused on the first state priority of education - teacher training - and minor pedagogy studies are one of the most effective and flexible ways to acquire a teacher qualification. As a result, all students who chose these studies had to receive equal support. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Amendments to the Procedure for Granting, Administering and Repaying State-Supported Student Loans (28 October 2020) </i></h3>
    <p>VU SR submitted proposals and comments on seven items in the description of the procedure for granting, administering and repaying state-supported student loans. VU SR pointed out that the previous version of the description does not provide favorable conditions for student repayment and does not encourage the use of this long-term financial assistance measure, which is especially relevant for ensuring students' opportunities to pursue higher education regardless of their economic situation. VU SR proposed to link the loan repayment installments to the borrower's income and to allow the loan to be repaid only when the borrower's income exceeds the amount of the minimum monthly salary. It was also proposed to extend the loan repayment term from 15 to 30 years, to extend the start of loan repayment from 12 to 24 months after graduation, to continue paying interest at the state funds to a student who has temporarily suspended studies. </p>


    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Application for the issuance of potassium iodide tablets to young people living in Vilnius (November 3, 2020) </i></h3>
    <p>VU SR together with the Vilnius Union of Youth Organizations Roundtable (VJOSAS) and the Lithuanian Medical Students' Association (LiMSA) submitted a letter to the Minister of Health of the Republic of Lithuania and the Director of Vilnius City Municipality Administration to expand the range of potassium iodide tablets to include students who study in Vilnius. According to the original plan, these tablets were issued only to people who had declared their place of residence in the territory of Vilnius City Municipality. In the case of an accident at the Astravas nuclear power plant in Belarus, such a procedure would endanger young people who have not declared their place of residence in the area in question. A proposal was made that a person could receive potassium iodide tablets if he presented a valid electronic student card, Lithuanian student card or a certificate issued by the employer. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>On the Regulations of the XVIII Government in the Field of Education (23 November 2020) </i></h3>
    <p>At the beginning of the work of the 18th Government of the Republic of Lithuania, VU SR submitted proposals for the program provisions to be formed by the Government in the field of education. In order to ensure sustainable decision-making in the field of higher education, proposals were formulated on higher education financing, strengthening the social dimension, improving the quality of studies, expanding the student support system, ensuring lifelong learning, optimizing the network of higher education institutions and other issues. Some of the proposals of VU SR, found in the document, are the provision of free higher education for students who are ready to study, attention to socially vulnerable groups with individual needs in the context of admission to higher education and service development, development of student involvement measures, increasing and offering retraining opportunities decoupling social status from academic performance through social scholarships. </p>


    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>On the Regulations of the XVIII Government in the Field of Higher Education and Their Implementation (11 January 2021)  </i></h3>
    <p>Taking into account the Government Program and the objectives contained therein that was accepted on 11 December,2020 in the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania, VU SR submitted proposals for the Government Program Implementation Plan. VU SR proposed more than 20 implementation measures for the five projects planned in the implementation plan. These measures included the preparation of incentives for students' involvement in research, creation of opportunities for students to work in universities, investment in infrastructure for popularization of science in Lithuania and support for student initiatives, proposal to develop a social dimension action plan based on foreign experience, free and freely available services for students, needs, funding for campus development programs, the opportunity to study for the first time free of charge in compensatory and / or additional studies, and other measures. </p>

    
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Regarding the Government of the Republic of Lithuania 2017 March 1 Resolution no. 149 Draft Amendment to the Law on the Implementation of the Law on Science and Studies of the Republic of Lithuania (26 January 2021) </i></h3>
    <p>Based on statistical data showing the situation that the share of funds per student in higher education in Lithuania is one of the lowest in the EU countries, VU SR approved the submitted draft resolution and proposed to further consistently increase the funding per student in higher education. Also, VU SR proposed to increase the part of the draft Resolution to promote student expenses from 4.5 to 5.5 BSB. In addition, VU SR called for attention to the problems of the social dimension after the entry into force of the planned amendments and recalled the proposal to prepare a plan for improving the Lithuanian social dimension and review the system of state-subsidized loans. </p>


    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Proposals for an educational action plan (10 February 2021) </i></h3>
    <p>In response to the need to achieve the highest quality and most accessible education system, VU SR together with the Lithuanian Students' Union (LMS) and the Lithuanian Council of Youth Organizations (LiJOT) submitted joint proposals in the field of education to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. Proposals were made in the areas of general education, higher education, lifelong learning and civic education. The document, drawn up by the three organizations, contains various proposals for complementing the projects, such as calling for greater emphasis on improving the psychosocial environment in schools, integrating the STEAM concept into curricula, more flexible secondary education, encouraging students to engage in research, addressing the social dimension in higher education, support for the development of mass open online courses (MOOCs) and more. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>On the universal inclusion of health students in higher education in the priority group of people to be vaccinated against COVID-19 infection (March 5, 2021) </i></h3>
    <p>VU SR together with the Lithuanian Medical Students' Association (LiMSA) and the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Student’s Representation (LSMU SA) submitted a letter to the Ministry of Health and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania proposing to include health science students in the priority group of people vaccinated against COVID-19 infection. As the development of clinical and practical skills is only possible through contact, it has been suggested that future health professionals be included in the priority list, as remotely taught subjects will not be repeated at the end of quarantine. The lack of knowledge in certain areas could possibly accompany students for the rest of their studies. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Regarding the draft amendment to the Law on Science and Studies (March 9, 2021) </i></h3>
    <p>In a letter, VU SR outlined the problems of social scholarship in Lithuania and expressed a proposal to expand the range of criteria for social scholarship recipients in order to reduce financial difficulties for students. Proposals were made for six items, two of which related to the extension of the scholarship criteria. With regard to the proposed changes, it is proposed to change the percentage of working capacity (from 45 to 55%)  and insert mild disability level into the criteria as well as the criteria of raising or caring for a minor child and the education of parents (if none has graduated from higher education) and deleting the academic debt factor in the loss of social scholarship. </p>



    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> <b>Research and analysis </b> </h1>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Analysis of students' socio-economic status during the COVID-19 crisis  </h3>
    <p>VVU SR, in cooperation with Vilnius University Faculty of Philosophy lecturers Rūta Žiliukaitė and Antanas Kairys, conducted a study of students’ living and studying conditions during the COVID-19 crisis. The aim of the study was to find out the impact of quarantine on students and the challenges of distance learning. 1253 students were interviewed, of which 85% are Vilnius University students. The majority of respondents (971 respondents) were bachelor students, 179 respondents studied for a master's degree, and the rest studied for a doctorate or other types of studies (residency, additional studies, etc.). The study revealed that the quality of studies deteriorated during quarantine mainly due to the lack of books, software or other means of study. In addition, at least a third of respondents were negatively affected financially during the COVID-19 pandemic and students who pay for their studies faced greater financial difficulties compared to those who do not pay for their studies. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">A study of physical activity at Vilnius University </h3>
    <p>VU SR, in cooperation with a Master’s student of Education Policy and Administration Studies at Vilnius University, conducted a study on students’ physical activity at Vilnius University. The aim of the research was to describe the problems and challenges of active lifestyle among students and to find out how active Vilnius University students are. 657 Vilnius University students responded to the survey. The average age of the respondents was 21.6 years and most of them (72%) were women. The study revealed that only 40% of respondents actively play sports, but do not necessarily do so in the University premises, which is why there is reason to believe that students' need for physical activity is not met in the University premises and most are unaware of the University's physical activity opportunities. Nevertheless, 70% of respondents said they took care of their health and found out the necessary information through social networks. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">A study of the distance learning experience </h3>
    <p>VU SR conducted a study on distance learning at Vilnius University in the autumn semester 2020. The aim of the study was to evaluate the study period from September 1, 2020 until October 26, 2020, when part of the study activities at the University were carried out remotely. The intention of the survey was to assess the quality of teaching, independent learning and workload, motivation and involvement in study, and satisfaction with studies. 513 Vilnius University students participated in the study, of which 377 respondents were bachelor's degree students, 52 respondents were master's degree students. The research revealed that the satisfaction with studies varies depending on the unit and may be conditioned by the quality of the implementation of practical classes. Those students whose studies were conducted only remotely felt less involved in their studies, and in general, the students' independent learning / workload during distance learning increased, which has a negative impact on their motivation, learning efficiency and satisfaction with studies. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Research of student internships </h3>
    <p>VU SR conducted a study of internships for students. The aim of the research was to find out the experiences of students with their internships, to gather information on internship realization, students’ satisfaction with the placement of internships in the study plan and the received information before and during the internship. 339 Vilnius University students participated in the study. The survey revealed that a large number of respondents do not agree with the statement that they consolidate the knowledge acquired during studies during the internship. The problem of informing students about reporting, as the respondents rated the knowledge about reporting requirements the worst. </p>
